and my conclusion my observation from this is
anybody can learn a second language in six months
how there are five principles maybe a few more but these are absolutely core
and before I get into those I just want to talk about two myths
I want to spell two myths
the first is you need talent
let me tell you about joe
joe came from australia when to holland was trying to learn dutch
struggling extremely extremely a great deal and finally
people were saying
you are completely useless
you are not talented give up you are waste of time
and she was very very depressed
and then she came across these five principles
she moved to brazil and she applied them and within six months and she was fluently in portuguese
so talent doesn't matter
people also think that immersion in a new country is the way to learn a language
but look around hongkong look at all the westerners who have been here for ten years
who don't speak a word of chinese
look at all the chinese living in america britain australia canada
have been there ten twenty years they don't speak any english
immersion per se dose not work why
because a drowning man can not learn to swim
when you don't speak  a language you're like a baby
if you drop yourself into a context which is all adult talking about
stuff over your head you won't learn
so what are the five priciples that you need to pay attention to?
first four words
attention meaning relevance and memory
and theses interconnect in very important ways
especially when you're talking about learning
come with me on a journey through a forest
you go on a walk through a forest and you see something like this
little marks on a tree maybe you pay attention maybe you don't
you go another fifty meters and you see this
you should be paying attention
another fifty meters if you haven't been paying attention you see this
and at this point you're paying attention
and you've just learned that this is important
it's relevant because it means this and anything that is related
and anything that is related any information related to your survival
is stuff that you're going to pay attention to and therefore you're going to remember it
If it's related to your personal goals then you're going to pay attention to it.
If it's relevant you're going to remember it.
So the first rule the first principle for learning a language is
focus on langage content that is relevant to you.
Which brings us to tools
we master tools by using tools
and we learn tools the fastest when they are relevant to us
So let me share a story
a keyborad is a tool
typing chinese a certain way there are methods for this.
that's a tool
I had a colleague many years ago
