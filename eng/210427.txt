and my conclusion my observation from this is
anybody can learn a second language in six months
how there are five principles maybe a few more but these are absolutely core
and before I get into those I just want to talk about two myths
I want to spell two myths
the first is you need talent
let me tell you about joe
joe came from australia when to holland was trying to learn dutch
struggling extremely extremely a great deal and finally
people were saying
you are completely useless
you are not talented give up you are waste of time
and she was very very depressed
and then she came across these five principles
she moved to brazil and she applied them and within six months and she was fluently in portuguese
so talent doesn't matter
people also think that immersion in a new country is the way to learn a language
but look around hongkong look at all the westerners who have been here for ten years
who don't speak a word of chinese
